				<h1>Rocking horse</h1>
				<p>Do you remember the rocking horse We played on as children? I do. Its body was a plastic hollow, Sturdy enough to carry the weight Of our tiny frames. We would lock In our trusting feet to its metal stirrups, And away we would go, up and down, On the spot, into the far off distance In our heads. And ever since, So it seems, I have been riding The same old rocking horse, going Nowhere, really, fixed in the same Old motion, up and down, up and down Galloping across the vast Expanse of my imagination to nowhere.</p>
